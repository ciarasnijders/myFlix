        Name of project: myFlix Project
    
        The web application myFlix will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.  
    </p>
    <p> 
        The 5 Ws
        ● Who — the immediate users will be frontend developers who’ll work on the client-side for the application based on what’s been documented on the server-side. The users of the myFlix application are movie/film enthusiasts who enjoy reading information about different movies.
        ● What — the complete server-side of the web application, including the server, business logic, and business layers of the application. It consists of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API is accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) have been used to retrieve data from the database and store that data in a non-relational way.
        ● When — whenever the users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the server-side of the application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the data in the database. These users are able to use the myFlix application whenever they like to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their list of “Favorite Movies.” 
        ● Where — the application will be hosted online. The myFlix application itself is responsive and can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.
        ● Why — movie/film enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies, directors, and genres. The server-side of the myFlix application ensures they have access to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be stored.
